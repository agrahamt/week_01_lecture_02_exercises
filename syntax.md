In your words, explain why the following text would NOT be considered valid HTML syntax. Additionally, predict if 'Will I be seen?' will show in the browser. Explain why or why not. Save your written answer to a file called syntax.md.

<html>
  <head>
    <body>
      Will I be seen?
    </body>
  </head>
</html>
It is not valid syntax because the head of the document is a separate section from the body.  The head contains metadata about the webpage as well as the title that appears in the browser tag at the top of the page.
The body tag is where the displayed contents of the page are located.  Normally, text in the head of an html page is not printed on the page.  However, browsers are robust and effective at recognizing mistakes and addressing them.  because "will I be seen?" is within the body tags, the page will print the sentence.
